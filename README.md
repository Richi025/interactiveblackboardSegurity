# InteractiveBlackBoard

This application is an interactive web-based whiteboard that allows multiple users to draw simultaneously on a shared canvas through a real-time connection using WebSocket technology. Additionally, it plans to implement the use of HTTPS security with a PKCS key.

On the other hand, this version of the dashboard has a login system.

### Features
+ **Draw**: You can draw consecutive circles using the mouse click.


## Starting

In order to use the project on your system, you can access the following link and download a compressed file of it.

[Repository](https://github.com/Richi025/interactiveblackboardSegurity.git) 

You can also clone the file using the following command.

```
git clone https://github.com/Richi025/interactiveblackboardSegurity.git  
```

## Configuration

configure the environment variables on your pc, these are found in the application.properties file, with sebartojs13

erver.ssl.key-store-password=${KEY_STORE_PASSWORD}

trust.store.password=${TRUST_STORE_PASSWORD}

### Previous requirements

It is necessary to have "**Maven**", "**Java**", installed, preferably in their latest versions.

#### Maven
```
Download Maven at http://maven.apache.org/download.html 

Follow the instructions at http://maven.apache.org/download.html#Installation
```
#### Java

```
Download Java at https://www.java.com/es/download/ie_manual.jsp
```

### Installing

Once you have the cloned project in your repository. Follow the steps below to launch the program successfully.

#### Run BackEnd Spring-boot and Run FrontEnd React Js

1. Open a terminal and enter the folder where I clone the repository and enter the BoardSpring folder.

2. Use the following command to compile and clean the target directory.
    ```
    mvn clean compile
    ```
3. Now use the following command to package the project as a JAR file.

    ```
    mvn package
    ```

4. Now you can run the project using the following command.

    ```
    mvn spring-boot:run

    Now the server is running.
    ```

4. Now there will be a browser and enter the following link and you can logging.

    http://localhost:8443/login

    To start playing use one of the users:

        username = "user1"
        password ="password1"

        username = "user2"
        password ="password2"

        username = "user3"
        password ="password3"

 5. Now you can start drawing

## Proyect Structure

## Summary of Functionality with Login and HTTPS Security

### 1. Spring Boot Server:

+ Configures and launches a WebSocket and REST server.
+ Provides a `/bbService` endpoint for WebSocket communication.
+ Provides a `/status` endpoint to check the server status.
+ Provides `/login` and `/logout` endpoints for user authentication.
+ Configures HTTPS for secure communication.

### 2. WebSocket:

+ **BBEndpoint** handles WebSocket communication: opens connections, processes messages, and manages errors.
+ Received messages are broadcast to all connected clients, except the one that sent the message.

### 3. Web Client (HTML + React + P5.js):

+ The HTML page loads React, P5.js, and the `bbComponents.jsx` component.
+ `bbComponents.jsx` defines the React components that manage the canvas and WebSocket communication.
+ Users can draw on the canvas, and the points are sent to the WebSocket server.
+ Points received from the server are drawn on the canvas of all connected clients.

### 4. User Authentication and HTTPS Security:

+ Manages user authentication with `/login` and `/logout` endpoints.
+ **WebSecurityConfig** ensures secure communication using HTTPS and manages user session security.
+ The login page (`login.html`) allows users to submit their credentials for authentication.
+ Authenticated sessions are managed by Spring Security, ensuring only authorized access to resources.

## Component Explanation with Login and HTTPS Security

### Java Packages (`co.edu.escuelaing.interactiveblackboardSegurity`):

- **BBConfigurator.java:** Configures a `ServerEndpointExporter` bean in Spring to enable WebSocket endpoints.
- **BBEndpoint.java:** Specifies the WebSocket server endpoint (`/bbService`) using the `@ServerEndpoint` annotation. Handles WebSocket connections, sending and receiving messages.
- **DrawingServiceController.java:** REST controller defining an endpoint (`/status`) to check the server's status.
- **LoginController.java:** REST controller defining login and logout endpoints for user authentication.
- **WebSecurityConfig.java:** Configures HTTPS security and user authentication using Spring Security.

### Spring Boot Application:

- **InteractiveblackboardApplication.java:** Entry point of the Spring Boot application. Configures and runs the Spring Boot application, specifying the port using the `getPort()` method and configuration files in `application.properties`.

### Static Resources:

- **js/bbComponents.jsx:** JavaScript file containing React components for the user interface. Uses P5.js to draw on an HTML5 canvas and WebSocket for real-time communication with the server.
- **js/loginComponents.jsx:** JavaScript file containing React components for the login interface.

### Static Files:

- **index.html:** Main HTML page of the web application. Loads React, P5.js, and babel to transpile JSX to JavaScript.
- **login.html:** HTML page for the login interface.

### Configuration File:

- **pom.xml:** Maven configuration file defining project dependencies, including Spring Boot, necessary libraries for React, WebSocket, and Spring Security.

### Data Flow:

1. **WebSocket Connection:** The client establishes a WebSocket connection with the server.
2. **Drawing Data (x, y):** When a user draws on the canvas, the position data (x, y) is sent to the server via WebSocket.
3. **Broadcasting Data:** The server broadcasts this data to all other connected clients, updating their canvases in real-time.
4. **Acknowledgment / Error Handling:** The server may send acknowledgments or handle errors as needed during data transmission.
5. **User Authentication:**
    - **Login:** Users submit their credentials via the login interface. The `LoginController` handles authentication.
    - **Session Management:** Once authenticated, the user session is managed by Spring Security.
6. **HTTPS Security:** All communication, including WebSocket, REST endpoints, and static resource access, is secured using HTTPS configured in `WebSecurityConfig`.
